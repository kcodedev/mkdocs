# Components of a Computer 🔧

Greetings! Computers consist of various components, each serving a specific function. These are known as hardware, which refers to the physical elements you can touch. 🖐️

Let us examine the primary components:

- **Monitor (Screen)** 📺: This displays images, text, and videos. It functions similarly to a television but is optimized for computer use.
- **Keyboard** ⌨️: Used for inputting letters, numbers, and symbols. Press the keys to enter data efficiently.
- **Mouse** 🖱️: Allows you to control the cursor on the screen. Move it to navigate, and click to select items. It's an intuitive tool!
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit or Tower)** 🖥️: The core processor that performs calculations and runs programs. It is the intelligent heart of the computer.
- **Power Button**: Activates or deactivates the device. Press it carefully to start or shut down.

Additional components include:

- **Speakers** 🔊: Output audio for music, videos, and alerts. Enjoy your favorite tunes!
- **Hard Drive** 💾: Stores data such as files, photos, and applications. It acts as the computer's memory storage.

These components collaborate to enable the computer's operations, much like parts of a team working together. 👫 Maintain cleanliness and avoid spills near the device to ensure longevity. 🍔❌
