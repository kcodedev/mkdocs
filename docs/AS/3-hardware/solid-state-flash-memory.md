## Key Information

⚡Solid state memory (aka flash memory) is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data in an array of memory cells <br>
⚡It can be volatile(RAM) or non-volatile(SSD) <br>
⚡It uses semiconductor technology and has no moving parts <br>
⚡Arrays of transistors act as memory cells <br>
⚡Most circuitry resembles that of a NAND logic gates <br>
⚡Data is “flashed” onto chips <br>

## NAND Flash Die

A NAND flash die is the semiconductor chip that contains the NAND flash memory cells, serving as the core component of solid-state drives (SSDs). It consists of millions of floating-gate transistors arranged in a grid-like structure, where each transistor acts as a memory cell capable of storing data bits.

### Structure of a NAND Flash Die

- **Memory Cells**: The basic unit, each a floating-gate transistor that stores charge to represent data (1s and 0s).
- **Pages**: Groups of cells (~ 4-16 KB) that are read or programmed together for efficiency.
- **Blocks**: Larger units (~ 128-512 pages) that must be erased as a whole before new data can be written.
- **Planes**: Subdivisions within a die that allow parallel operations for better performance.
- **Dies**: The physical chip itself; multiple dies can be stacked or packaged together in modern SSDs.
