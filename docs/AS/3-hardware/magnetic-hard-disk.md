> How in the hell did anyone ever come up with this technology and then create it!? The engineering, timing, and precision required is staggering. Amazing video, thank you.


## Structure of a HDD

- A HDD has one or more **platters** made of aluminium coated with magnetised metal grains
- The platters/disks **rotate** around a central spindle at [high-speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3owqvmMf6No)
- **Read/write heads** are mounted on **actuator** arms and positioned over each platter surface
- Electronic circuits control the movement of the arm and heads
- The surface of the platter/disk is divided into concentric tracks, each divided into sectors
- The basic unit of storage is called a block, each block has data encoded as a magnetic pattern

## Reading and Writing

![Read Write Head](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Hard_disk_read_write_head_and_data_connector.jpg/330px-Hard_disk_read_write_head_and_data_connector.jpg)

The read/write head is an **electromagnet** and is positioned very close to the disk surface (a few nanometres). 

When writing, a change in the current in the head produces a variation in the magnetic field on the disk, aligning magnetic grains to represent binary 1s (one magnetic direction) or 0s (opposite direction). 

When reading, a change in the magnetic field on the disk produces a variation in current through the head, allowing detection of the binary value based on the magnetic orientation.

## 1950s Hard Disk Drive

> This is a picture of an IBM hard drive being loaded onto an airplane in 1956. According to @HistoricalPics, which tweeted the picture, it's a 5 mega-byte drive, and it weighed more than 2,000 pounds.
