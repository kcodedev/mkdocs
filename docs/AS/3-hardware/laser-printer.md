## Laser Printing Process

💻 Printer driver checks printer is online and ready for use<br>
📄 Data is sent to the printer and stored in the **printer buffer** (temporary memory)<br>
🛢️ Printing **drum** given a positive charge<br>
💥🔫 As the drum spins a **laser** beam moves across it removing positive charge in certain areas<br>
➕ Drum is coated with positively charged **toner** which ...<br>
➖... will only stick to the negatively charged parts of the drum<br>
📜 Sheet of paper is rolled over the drum<br>
📜 Toner on the drum sticks to the paper to produce the image<br>
☀️ The paper goes through a **fuser** where heat melts the ink to permanently fix it to the paper<br>
💡 A discharge lamp removes all electric charge from the drum.<br>
