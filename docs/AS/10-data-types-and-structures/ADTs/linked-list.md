# üîó Linked List: Dynamic and Flexible Connections

Think of a linked list as a chain of paperclips üìé ‚Äì each one connects to the next, allowing you to add, remove, or rearrange links easily without fixed positions.

## üß† What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a linear data structure made of **nodes**, where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Size**: Grows or shrinks without (usually) predefined limits.
- **Non-Contiguous Storage**: Nodes can be scattered in memory, linked by pointers.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: No shifting of elements like in arrays.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operations on a Linked List

Linked lists allow adding, editing, and deleting data through node manipulation:

- **Insert**: Add a node at the beginning, end, or specific position by updating links.
- **Delete**: Remove a node by adjusting the previous and next links.
- **Traverse**: Walk through nodes from head to tail to access or view data.
- **Search**: Find a node by value, starting from the head.
- **Size**: Count nodes by traversing the list.

## üí° When to Use a Linked List?

Linked lists shine in **dynamic scenarios** where frequent insertions/deletions occur or size is unpredictable:

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: In systems needing resizable lists, like browser tabs.
- **Implementation of Other ADTs**: Stacks or queues can use linked lists for unlimited size.
- **Music/Playlist Management**: Easily insert or delete songs without reindexing.
- **Undo History in Editors**: Add/remove entries efficiently.

**Justification:** Opt for linked lists when operations are O(1) for insert/delete at known positions, avoiding the O(n) shifts in arrays for variable data.

## üîß Implementing a Linked List with Arrays

While linked lists typically use pointers, they can be simulated using an **array of structures**, where each "node" is an array entry with value and next index. To make it more efficient, especially after deletions, this implementation includes a **free pointer** that tracks a chain of unused slots. This simulates a free list, allowing reuse of freed space instead of always allocating sequentially. It prevents waste and fragmentation in the fixed array "heap".

### How Free Space Management Works
- **Initialization**: Link all array slots into a free list (e.g., for size 8: index 0's next=1, 1's next=2, ..., 7's next=-1). Set `free = 0` (first free slot) and `head = -1`.
- **Insertion**:
  - Check if `free == -1` (full array). If not, allocate `new_idx = free`, remove it from free list (`free = nodes[free].next`), set node's value and next=head, update head.
- **Deletion** (of target index):
  - Update previous node's next to skip target.
  - Add target to free list: Set its value="-", next=`free`, then `free = target`.
- **Benefits**: O(1) average allocation/deallocation, reuses space, better simulates dynamic memory.
- **Note**: Still bounded by array size, but more realistic for systems with fixed memory pools.

### Pseudocode for Operations
```
ARRAY nodes[MAX_SIZE]  // Each: [value, next], e.g., MAX_SIZE=8
free = 0
FOR i = 0 TO MAX_SIZE-2:
    nodes[i].next = i+1
nodes[MAX_SIZE-1].next = -1
head = -1

PROCEDURE Insert(value):
    IF free == -1:
        ERROR "Array full"
    new_idx = free
    free = nodes[free].next
    nodes[new_idx].value = value
    nodes[new_idx].next = head
    head = new_idx

PROCEDURE Delete(target_idx):  // Assumes target_idx is in list; find previous first
    // ... (find prev such that nodes[prev].next == target_idx)
    nodes[prev].next = nodes[target_idx].next
    nodes[target_idx].value = "-"
    nodes[target_idx].next = free
    free = target_idx
    IF head == target_idx:
        head = nodes[target_idx].next
```

### Visualization with Fixed Array

Start with free list: 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7‚Üí-1, free=0, head=-1. All values="-".

#### Initial: Completely Empty (free=0, head=-1)

| Index | Value | Next Pointer |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | -     | 1            |
| 1     | -     | 2            |
| 2     | -     | 3            |
| 3     | -     | 4            |
| 4     | -     | 5            |
| 5     | -     | 6            |
| 6     | -     | 7            |
| 7     | -     | -1           |

#### Step 1: Insert 10 at Beginning (allocate 0, free=1, head=0)
| Index | Value | Next Pointer |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 10    | -1           |
| 1     | -     | 2            |
| 2     | -     | 3            |
| 3     | -     | 4            |
| 4     | -     | 5            |
| 5     | -     | 6            |
| 6     | -     | 7            |
| 7     | -     | -1           |

#### Step 2: Insert 20 at Beginning (allocate 1, free=2), head=1
| Index | Value | Next Pointer |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 10    | -1           |
| 1     | 20    | 0            |
| 2     | -     | 3            |
| 3     | -     | 4            |
| 4     | -     | 5            |
| 5     | -     | 6            |
| 6     | -     | 7            |
| 7     | -     | -1           |

#### Step 3: Delete 20 (index 1), add to free (free=1, 1‚Üí2)
List now: head=0 (10‚Üí-1). Free list: 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7‚Üí-1.

| Index | Value | Next Pointer |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 10    | -1           |
| 1     | -     | 2            |
| 2     | -     | 3            |
| 3     | -     | 4            |
| 4     | -     | 5            |
| 5     | -     | 6            |
| 6     | -     | 7            |
| 7     | -     | -1           |

#### Step 4: Insert 30 at Beginning (reuse 1, free=2), head=1
| Index | Value | Next Pointer |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0     | 10    | -1           |
| 1     | 30    | 0            |
| 2     | -     | 3            |
| 3     | -     | 4            |
| 4     | -     | 5            |
| 5     | -     | 6            |
| 6     | -     | 7            |
| 7     | -     | -1           |

**Note**: Reuse of index 1 shows efficient space management. Traverse from head, following next pointers.

**Limitations**: Requires finding previous node for deletion (O(n) time). For production, use doubly-linked for O(1) deletes.
