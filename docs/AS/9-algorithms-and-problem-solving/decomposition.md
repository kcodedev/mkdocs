# Decomposition 🧩

## Describing Decomposition 📖

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. It's like dividing a big puzzle into smaller pieces! 🧩

## Using Decomposition in Problem-Solving 🔧

To use decomposition:

1. Identify the main problem. 🎯
2. Break it down into smaller sub-problems. ✂️
3. Solve each sub-problem individually. ✅
4. Combine the solutions to form the overall solution. 🔗

## Breaking Down Problems into Sub-Problems Leading to Program Modules 🏗️

This leads to the concept of program modules, such as procedures or functions. Each sub-problem can be implemented as a separate module, making the code more organized and maintainable. 📦

For example, in a program to calculate grades, you might have modules for input, calculation, and output.
