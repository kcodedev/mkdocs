## Purpose of a Development Life Cycle

The program development life cycle (PDLC) is a structured approach to software development that outlines the phases a project goes through from inception to completion and maintenance. Its primary purpose is to ensure that software is developed systematically, reducing risks, improving quality, and managing resources effectively. 

By following a life cycle, developers can identify requirements early, plan for changes, and deliver reliable software that meets user needs. It promotes collaboration among stakeholders, helps in estimating costs and timelines, and provides a framework for testing and validation to minimize errors in the final product.

## Stages of the Development Life Cycle

The typical stages of a PDLC include:

- **Analysis**: This stage involves gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders. Developers identify the problem, define objectives, and specify functional and non-functional requirements. The goal is to understand what the software needs to achieve and create a clear specification document.

- **Design**: Based on the analysis, the design phase creates a blueprint for the software. This includes architectural design (high-level structure), detailed design (algorithms, data structures), and user interface design. The output is design documents that guide implementation.

- **Coding**: In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. They use programming languages and tools to implement the features. Best practices like code reviews and version control are employed to ensure quality.

- **Testing**: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs. This includes unit testing (individual components), integration testing (combined parts), system testing (entire system), and user acceptance testing (by end-users). The aim is to ensure the software meets requirements and is free from defects.

- **Maintenance**: After deployment, the software enters maintenance, where it is monitored, updated, and fixed as needed. This includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and adaptations to new requirements or environments.

## Different Life Cycle Models

Different projects may require different life cycle models based on factors like project size, complexity, requirements stability, and time constraints. Three common models are Waterfall, Iterative, and Rapid Application Development (RAD).
