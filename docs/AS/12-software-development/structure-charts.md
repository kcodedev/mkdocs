## Purpose of Structure Charts

Structure charts are hierarchical diagrams that represent the decomposition of a program into modules or sub-tasks. They visually show the relationships between modules and the data flow (parameters) between them. This helps in understanding the program's architecture, improving modularity, and making it easier to implement and maintain.

To construct a structure chart:

1. **Identify the main module**
2. **Decompose into sub-modules**
3. **Show hierarchy**
4. **Indicate parameters**

## Structure Chart Notation

Structure charts use standard symbols to represent program logic:

- Module: shown as a **rectangle**.  
- Data Flow: **arrows** showing data passed between modules.  
- Control Flow: **lines** showing hierarchy (calling relationships).  
- Selection: shown as a **diamond** on the connecting line.  
- Iteration (Loops): shown as a **looping arrow** on the connection to a module.
