# Threats to Computer and Data Security

Networks and the internet have revolutionized communication and information sharing, but they also introduce significant security risks. Understanding these threats is crucial for implementing effective protection measures.

## Malware Threats

Malware encompasses various types of malicious software designed to harm or exploit computer systems.

### Viruses
- **Definition**: Self-replicating programs that attach to legitimate files or programs
- **Propagation**: Spread through infected files, email attachments, or removable media
- **Damage**: Can delete files, corrupt data, or render systems unusable
- **Examples**: File viruses, boot sector viruses, macro viruses

### Spyware
- **Definition**: Software that secretly monitors user activity and collects information
- **Methods**: Keyloggers, screen capture, browser tracking
- **Risks**: Privacy invasion, identity theft, unauthorized data collection
- **Examples**: Adware, tracking cookies, system monitors

### Other Malware Types
- **Worms**: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user intervention
- **Trojans**: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts user data and demands payment for decryption
- **Rootkits**: Hide malicious activity and maintain unauthorized access

## Human Threats

### Hackers
- **Definition**: Individuals who gain unauthorized access to computer systems
- **Motivations**: Financial gain, political activism, curiosity, revenge
- **Methods**:
  - **Brute Force Attacks**: Trying multiple password combinations
  - **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to reveal confidential information
  - **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Using software weaknesses to gain access
  - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting communications between parties

### Phishing
- **Definition**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by masquerading as trustworthy entities
- **Methods**:
  - **Email Phishing**: Fake emails appearing to be from legitimate sources
  - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks using personal information
  - **Whaling**: Phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals
  - **Pharming**: Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones

### Pharming
- **Definition**: Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent sites
- **Methods**:
  - **DNS Poisoning**: Corrupting DNS servers to redirect traffic
  - **Host File Modification**: Altering local host files
  - **Malware-based**: Using malicious software to redirect browsers

## Network and Internet-Specific Threats

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
- **Definition**: Overwhelming a system with traffic to make it unavailable
- **Methods**: Botnets coordinating attacks from multiple compromised devices
- **Impact**: Service disruption, financial losses, reputational damage

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **Definition**: Intercepting and possibly altering communications between two parties
- **Methods**: Wi-Fi eavesdropping, DNS spoofing, session hijacking
- **Risks**: Data theft, injection of malicious content

### SQL Injection
- **Definition**: Inserting malicious SQL code into queries to manipulate databases
- **Methods**: Exploiting poorly sanitized user inputs in web applications
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Definition**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users
- **Methods**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, defacement, malware distribution

## Emerging Threats

### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- **Definition**: Long-term targeted attacks by sophisticated adversaries
- **Characteristics**: Stealthy, persistent, often state-sponsored
- **Methods**: Zero-day exploits, custom malware, insider access

### Internet of Things (IoT) Vulnerabilities
- **Definition**: Security weaknesses in connected devices
- **Risks**: Botnet creation, privacy invasion, physical safety threats
- **Examples**: Insecure smart home devices, vulnerable industrial control systems

### Supply Chain Attacks
- **Definition**: Compromising software through third-party vendors
- **Methods**: Tampering with legitimate software updates or libraries
- **Impact**: Widespread infection through trusted sources

## Threat Vectors and Entry Points

### Email
- Malicious attachments, phishing links, spam
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks

### Web Browsing
- Drive-by downloads, malicious websites, browser exploits
- Malvertising (malicious advertisements)

### Removable Media
- Infected USB drives, external hard disks
- Autorun malware on portable devices

### Wireless Networks
- Rogue access points, Wi-Fi eavesdropping
- Bluetooth vulnerabilities

### Social Media
- Phishing through social platforms
- Information gathering for targeted attacks

## Impact of Threats

### Individual Users
- Identity theft, financial loss, privacy invasion
- System performance degradation, data loss

### Organizations
- Financial losses, operational disruption
- Reputational damage, legal consequences
- Intellectual property theft

### Society
- Critical infrastructure compromise
- Erosion of trust in digital systems
- Economic damage from cybercrime

Understanding these threats is the first step toward effective cybersecurity. Organizations and individuals must stay vigilant, keep systems updated, and implement comprehensive security measures to mitigate these risks.
