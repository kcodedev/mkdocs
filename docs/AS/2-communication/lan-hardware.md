# 🖧 LAN Hardware: What Keeps a Network Running?

Let’s explore some hardware used to create LANS! 🚀

---

## 🧠 1. Server

- A **powerful computer** that provides services or resources to other devices (clients) on the network.

**Examples of servers:**
- File server (stores files)
- Print server (manages printers)
- Web server (hosts websites)

🗂️ Think of a server as the network's brain — responding to requests and managing data!

---

## 🖧 2. Switch

- A **central device** that connects devices in a LAN.
- It **forwards data** only to the device it’s intended for (unlike a hub).

⚡ Fast, efficient, and intelligent — the switch reduces unnecessary traffic!

---

## 💳 3. Network Interface Card (NIC)

- A **hardware component** inside each computer that connects it to a wired network.
- Each NIC has a unique **MAC address**.

🧩 No NIC, no network! It’s essential for communication.

---

## 📡 4. Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC)

- Like a NIC, but for **wireless** connections (e.g., laptops, phones).
- Uses radio signals to communicate with a wireless access point.

📶 Without a WNIC, your device can't join Wi-Fi!

---

## 📶 5. Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- Allows wireless devices to **connect to a wired network**.
- Connects to the switch and broadcasts Wi-Fi signals.

🏠 Acts like a digital doorway into the LAN for phones, tablets, and laptops.

---

## 🔌 6. Cables

- Physical wires used to connect devices and carry data.
- Common types:
  - **Ethernet (Cat5/6)**: most common
  - **Fibre optic**: for very fast and long-distance connections

🧵 The veins of a LAN — transporting data like blood in a body!

---

## 🌉 7. Bridge

- Connects **two different LAN segments** so they work as one.
- Can reduce traffic by separating devices into groups.

🌉 Like a bridge over a river, it connects two islands of networks!

---

## 🔁 8. Repeater

- **Amplifies signals** to extend the range of the network.
- Used when devices are far apart and the signal weakens.

📡📡 It’s like shouting down a hallway — the repeater shouts again so the message travels farther!
