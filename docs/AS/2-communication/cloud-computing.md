# ☁️ Understanding Cloud Computing

Cloud computing lets people and organizations use computing resources (like storage, servers, software) **over the Internet** instead of owning them locally. Think of it as renting computers and services on demand!

## 🌍 What is Cloud Computing?

- Using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data 💾📡
- Instead of relying on your own computer or servers, you access resources **“in the cloud”**

## ☁️ Types of Clouds

### 1. Public Cloud 🌐

- Services and resources are offered to the **general public** by providers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud
- Shared infrastructure among many users

**Examples:**
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Netflix streaming

### 2. Private Cloud 🔒

- Cloud infrastructure is **dedicated to a single organization**
- More control over security and data privacy

**Examples:**
- A company’s internal cloud for confidential data
- Government clouds for sensitive information
