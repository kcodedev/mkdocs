# 📡 Network Topologies: Bus, Star, Mesh & Hybrid

When setting up a network, how computers are physically or logically connected is called the **network topology**. Each topology has unique features, advantages, and ways of transmitting data (packets).

Let’s explore the four common topologies! 🚀

---

## 🚌 1. Bus Topology

### What is it?

- All devices share a **single communication line (bus)**.
- Data sent by one device travels along the bus until it reaches the target device.

### Packet Transmission

- The packet travels along the bus in both directions.
- Each device checks if the packet’s address matches their own.
- If not, it passes it along until the destination is reached.

### Pros
- Easy and cheap to set up 💸
- Requires less cable than other topologies 🔌

### Cons
- If the main cable breaks, the whole network fails ⚠️
- Performance slows down as more devices join 🐢

### Best use case
- Small, simple networks with few devices 🏠

---

## ⭐ 2. Star Topology

### What is it?

- All devices connect to a **central hub or switch**.
- The hub manages all data traffic.

### Packet Transmission

- Data is sent from the source device to the hub.
- The hub then forwards the data to the destination device only.

### Pros
- If one device fails, others keep working ✅
- Easy to add or remove devices ➕

### Cons
- If the hub fails, the whole network goes down 🚫
- More cable required than bus topology 🔌

### Best use case
- Offices or schools where reliability matters 🏢

---

## 🌐 3. Mesh Topology

### What is it?

- Every device is connected to **every other device**.
- Provides multiple paths for data.

### Packet Transmission

- Packets can take multiple paths to reach the destination.
- If one path fails, packets are rerouted automatically.

### Pros
- Highly reliable and fault-tolerant 🔒
- Fast data transmission through multiple routes ⚡

### Cons
- Very expensive and complex to set up 💰
- Requires lots of cables and ports 🔌🔌

### Best use case
- Critical systems like military or data centers 🚀

---

## 🔀 4. Hybrid Topology

### What is it?

- A **combination** of two or more different topologies (e.g., star + bus).

### Packet Transmission

- Depends on the mixed topologies used.
- Can be optimized for both cost and performance.

### Pros
- Flexible and scalable 🛠️
- Can be designed to suit specific needs 🎯

### Cons
- Can be complex to design and maintain 🧩

### Best use case
- Large organizations with diverse network needs 🏢🌍

## 🛣️ How Packets Travel in Different Topologies

| Topology   | Packet Transmission Method                     | Failure Impact                   |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Bus        | Broadcast along the shared bus                 | Cable break stops entire network |
| Star       | Sent via central hub to destination            | Hub failure stops entire network |
| Mesh       | Routed via multiple possible paths             | Redundant paths prevent failure  |
| Hybrid     | Depends on mixed topologies                     | Depends on design                |

## ✅ Choosing the Right Topology

| Scenario                        | Recommended Topology       | Reason                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Small, budget home network      | Bus                        | Cheap and simple                        |
| School or office network        | Star                       | Reliable, easy to manage                |
| Mission-critical system         | Mesh                       | Maximum reliability and fault tolerance |
| Large organization with varied needs | Hybrid                | Flexible and scalable                   |
