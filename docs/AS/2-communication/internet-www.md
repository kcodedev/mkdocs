# 🌐 The World Wide Web vs. The Internet

Many people use the terms **"internet"** and **"World Wide Web" (WWW)** as if they mean the same thing — but they’re **not**! Let’s break it down.

---

## 🧠 What is the Internet?

- A **global network of computers** and devices linked together 🌍
- Includes all the hardware (e.g. routers, cables, satellites, servers)
- Transmits data using the **Internet Protocol (IP)** 📡

> ✅ Think of it like the **roads and highways** that connect cities — it’s the infrastructure.

---

## 🌐 What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?

- A **service that runs on the internet**
- Made up of **websites and web pages** that you view using a browser (like Chrome or Firefox) 🧭
- Uses **HTTP** or **HTTPS** to request and transfer content 🛜

> ✅ The Web is like **cars and content** that travel on the roads — it’s just **one use** of the internet.

## 🚀 Quick Quiz!

Can you say whether each example is part of the Internet, the Web, or both—and why?

| Example                                | Internet 🌍 | Web 🌐 | Explanation                                                                                           |

| Sending an email via a desktop client 📧 | ✅           | ❌      | Uses SMTP/IMAP over the Internet directly, not HTTP/HTTPS—no web pages involved.                        |
| Accessing email via a browser (webmail) 🌐📧 | ✅           | ✅      | Uses HTTP/HTTPS in a browser to interact with mail stored on a web server—so it’s both Web and Internet. |
| Watching a YouTube video ▶️            | ✅           | ✅      | Streams over the Internet and uses HTTP/HTTPS in your browser to display the web page.                 |
| Downloading a file via FTP 📂          | ✅           | ❌      | Uses the FTP protocol over the Internet; it doesn’t involve web pages or HTTP requests.                 |
| Browsing Wikipedia 📖                  | ✅           | ✅      | Accesses Wikipedia’s pages via HTTP/HTTPS over the Internet—so it’s both Web and Internet use.         |
