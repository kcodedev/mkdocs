## 🔑 What is a Software License?

A software license is like a permission slip for using, copying, or sharing code. It tells you what you can do with the software. Open-source licenses are popular because they encourage sharing and collaboration. 😊

## 📋 Common Open-Source Licenses

Let's break down some popular ones step by step.

### 1. MIT License
The MIT License is super simple and permissive. 🛡️

- **What it allows**: Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sell copies.
- **Requirements**: Include the original license and copyright notice in copies.
- **Pros**: Easy to use, no restrictions on commercial use.
- **Cons**: Doesn't require sharing changes back.
- **Best for**: Libraries and projects wanting wide adoption.

Example: Many JavaScript libraries use MIT.

### 2. GNU General Public License (GPL)
The GPL is "copyleft" – it ensures freedom spreads! 🆓

- **What it allows**: Use, modify, and distribute, but derivatives must also be GPL-licensed.
- **Requirements**: Share source code if you distribute the software.
- **Pros**: Protects user freedoms, forces openness.
- **Cons**: Can be restrictive for proprietary software.
- **Best for**: Projects like Linux kernel that want to stay free.

Versions: GPL v2 and v3 (v3 adds patent protection).

### 3. Apache License 2.0
The Apache License is permissive but adds patent grants. 🏛️

- **What it allows**: Use, modify, distribute (even commercially), no need to share changes.
- **Requirements**: Include license, notice changes, and state contributions.
- **Pros**: Clear patent protection, good for big projects.
- **Cons**: A bit more paperwork than MIT.
- **Best for**: Enterprise software, like Android.

### 4. BSD License
The BSD License is short and sweet, similar to MIT. 📦

- **What it allows**: Use, modify, distribute freely.
- **Requirements**: Keep the copyright notice in source and binaries.
- **Pros**: Very flexible, no "copyleft."
- **Cons**: No patent grants (unlike Apache).
- **Best for**: Academic or quick projects.

Variants: 2-clause (simpler) or 3-clause (adds endorsement clause).
