# 📐 Design Methods

Several tools help design algorithms and systems before coding begins. These include structure diagrams, flowcharts, and pseudocode.

---

## 🏗️ Structure Diagrams

Visual representation of system hierarchy:

- **Purpose**: Show relationships between components
- **Structure**: Main system → Sub-systems → Components
- **Benefits**: Clear overview of system organization

---

## 📈 Flowcharts

Step-by-step visual representation of processes:

- **Symbols**:
  - Rectangle: Process/Action
  - Diamond: Decision
  - Arrow: Flow direction
  - Oval: Start/End
  - Parallelogram: Input/Output

- **Purpose**: Show algorithm logic and flow
- **Benefits**: Easy to understand and follow

---

## 📝 Pseudocode

Written description of algorithm logic:

- **Format**: English-like statements
- **Purpose**: Plan code before writing in programming language
- **Benefits**: Language-independent, focuses on logic

---

## 🔍 Algorithm Purpose

Every algorithm should have a clear purpose:

- **State the purpose**: What does the algorithm do?
- **Describe processes**: How does it work?
- **Identify inputs/outputs**: What data is used and produced?

## 📋 Example Flowchart

```
Start
  ↓
Input data
  ↓
Process data
  ↓
Is condition met?
  ├── Yes → Action A
  └── No → Action B
  ↓
Output result
  ↓
End
```

## 📝 **Key Points:**

- Structure diagrams show system organization ✅
- Flowcharts visualize process flow ✅
- Pseudocode describes algorithm logic ✅
- Each algorithm has a clear purpose ✅
