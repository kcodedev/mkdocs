# 🔄 Program Development Life Cycle

The program development life cycle is a structured approach to creating software. It consists of four main stages: analysis, design, coding, and testing.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Stage

The first step involves understanding the problem:

- **Identify the problem**: What needs to be solved?
- **Requirements gathering**: What inputs, processes, and outputs are needed?
- **Abstraction**: Focus on essential features, ignore unnecessary details
- **Decomposition**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts

---

## 📐 Design Stage

Plan the solution before writing code:

- **Decomposition**: Divide the problem into sub-systems
- **Structure diagrams**: Visual representation of system components
- **Flowcharts**: Step-by-step process diagrams
- **Pseudocode**: Written description of the algorithm

---

## 💻 Coding Stage

Write the actual program:

- **Choose programming language**: Based on requirements
- **Write code**: Implement the design
- **Iterative testing**: Test as you code
- **Documentation**: Comment code for clarity

---

## 🧪 Testing Stage

Verify the program works correctly:

- **Test with sample data**: Check all scenarios
- **Debug errors**: Fix any issues found
- **Validate results**: Ensure output meets requirements
- **Iterate**: Return to previous stages if needed

---

## 🔁 The Cycle

The process is iterative - you may need to go back to earlier stages:

```
Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing
    ↑           ↓         ↓       ↓
    └───────────┼─────────┼───────┘
```

## 📝 **Key Points:**

- Analysis: Understand problem and requirements ✅
- Design: Plan the solution ✅
- Coding: Write the program ✅
- Testing: Verify it works correctly ✅
