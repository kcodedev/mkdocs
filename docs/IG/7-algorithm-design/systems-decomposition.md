# 🧩 Systems and Decomposition

Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable parts through decomposition. Every computer system consists of sub-systems that work together.

## 🏗️ System Structure

Computer systems are hierarchical:

- **Main System**: The overall problem or application
- **Sub-systems**: Smaller components that make up the main system
- **Further Sub-systems**: Even smaller parts within sub-systems

---

## ✂️ Decomposition Process

Breaking down problems into components:

- **Identify main functions**: What does the system need to do?
- **Divide into sub-systems**: Group related functions together
- **Continue decomposition**: Break sub-systems into smaller parts
- **Define interfaces**: How sub-systems communicate

## 📊 Structure Diagrams

Visual representation of system components:

```
[Main System]
├── [Sub-system 1]
│   ├── [Component 1.1]
│   └── [Component 1.2]
└── [Sub-system 2]
    ├── [Component 2.1]
    └── [Component 2.2]
```

## 🔗 System Components

Every system has:

- **Inputs**: Data entering the system
- **Processes**: Operations performed on data
- **Outputs**: Results produced by the system
- **Storage**: Data saved for later use

---

## 🎯 Benefits of Decomposition

- **Simpler management**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other systems
- **Testing**: Individual parts can be tested separately
- **Team work**: Different teams can work on different components
