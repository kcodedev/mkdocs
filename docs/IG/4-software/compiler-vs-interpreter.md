# Compiler vs Interpreter 🖥️⚙️

---

## What Is a Compiler? 🧑‍💻🔄

A **compiler** translates the entire high-level program **all at once** into machine code before the program runs.

- Produces an **executable file** you can run later.
- Checks for errors in the whole code and provides a **complete error report** before execution.
- Once compiled successfully, the program runs quickly.

## What Is an Interpreter? 🐍💻

An **interpreter** translates and executes high-level code **line-by-line**, on the fly.

- No separate executable file is created.
- If an error occurs, the interpreter **stops immediately** and reports the error.
- Useful for testing and debugging small sections of code.

## How They Translate High-Level Code

| Feature              | Compiler                         | Interpreter                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Translation          | Whole program at once            | One line at a time             |
| Output               | Standalone executable file       | No executable file            |
| Error reporting      | Reports all errors after compiling| Stops and reports error immediately |
| Execution speed      | Faster (after compilation)       | Slower (translation at runtime)|
| Use case             | Large, finished programs         | Development, debugging, scripts|

## Summary 🎯

- **Compiler:** Translates entire program, reports all errors before running, creates fast executable.  
- **Interpreter:** Translates and runs code line-by-line, stops at first error, great for quick testing.

Both tools help turn human-readable code into machine instructions, but in different ways! 🚀
