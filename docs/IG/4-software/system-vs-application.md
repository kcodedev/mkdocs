# System Software vs Application Software 🖥️📱

---

## What Is System Software? ⚙️

**System software** is the foundational software that helps run and manage the computer’s hardware and system resources. It acts as a bridge between hardware and user-level applications.

### Examples:
- 💽 **Operating Systems** (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 🧰 **Utility Programs** (e.g. antivirus, disk cleanup tools)
- 🔧 **Device Drivers** – special programs that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware components. (e.g. A **printer driver** lets your OS talk to and control your printer.)
- 🌐 **Language Translators** (e.g. compilers, assemblers, interpreters) — these translate code into machine-readable instructions.

## What Is Application Software? 📦

**Application software** is designed to help users perform specific tasks or applications.

### Examples:
- 📝 **Word Processors** (e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
- 🌐 **Web Browsers** (e.g. Chrome, Firefox)
- 📊 **Spreadsheet Programs** (e.g. Excel)
- More:
    - Image Editors
    - Graphic Manipulation
    - Video Editors
