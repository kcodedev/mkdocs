# 🚨 Interrupts: How Your Computer Stays Alert

An **interrupt** is a signal that tells the CPU to pause what it’s doing and pay attention to something important. Think of it as your computer getting tapped on the shoulder 👈💻

---

## 🔔 How Is an Interrupt Generated?

Interrupts can come from:

- 🖱️ **Hardware** – like pressing a key, moving the mouse, or plugging in a USB
- 🧩 **Software** – like a program trying to divide by zero or access restricted memory

---

## 🧠 What Happens During an Interrupt?

1. The current process is **paused** (its state is saved)
2. An **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** is triggered to handle the event
3. Once handled, the original process **resumes** like nothing happened

This allows the computer to **respond instantly** to important events without crashing or ignoring them 💨

## 🔍 Examples of Interrupts

### 🛠️ Hardware Interrupts
- Pressing a keyboard key ⌨️
- Moving the mouse 🖱️
- Disk drive completing a file read 💽

### 🧮 Software Interrupts
- Division by zero ❌➗
- Two processes trying to access the same memory 💥

## 🔄 Why Are Interrupts Important?

Interrupts make your system **responsive and efficient**. Without them, the CPU would have to constantly check everything — wasting time and power 🔋

---

🎯 **Summary:**  
Interrupts allow your computer to react quickly, juggle tasks efficiently, and keep everything running smoothly — just like a multitasking superhero! 🦸‍♂️💻
