# 🖥️ Computer Architecture

The computer architecture refers to the design and organization of a computer's components, particularly the CPU (Central Processing Unit), which acts as the "brain" of the computer. It processes instructions and data to perform tasks.

## 🧠 The Role of the CPU

The CPU is the primary component that executes instructions from programs. It fetches data from memory, processes it using arithmetic and logic operations, and stores the results back in memory.

- **Microprocessor**: A complete CPU on a single integrated circuit chip
- **Embedded Systems**: Specialized computers designed for specific functions (e.g., in cars, appliances, security systems)

---

## 🏗️ Von Neumann Architecture

Most computers follow the Von Neumann architecture, which includes:

- **Components**:
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs mathematical and logical operations
  - Control Unit (CU): Directs the operation of the processor
  - Registers: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU
  - Buses: Pathways for data transfer (address bus, data bus, control bus)

## 🔄 The Fetch-Decode-Execute (FDE) Cycle

The CPU operates in a continuous cycle:

1. **Fetch**: Retrieve the next instruction from memory
2. **Decode**: Interpret the instruction
3. **Execute**: Carry out the instruction

## ⚡ Performance Factors

Several factors affect CPU performance:

- **Cores**: Multiple processing units within a single CPU chip
- **Cache**: High-speed memory that stores frequently used data
- **Clock Speed**: The rate at which the CPU processes instructions

---

## 📋 Instruction Set

An instruction set is a collection of commands that the CPU can execute. These are machine code instructions that tell the CPU what operations to perform.

## 📝 **Key Points:**

- CPU processes all computer instructions ✅
- Von Neumann architecture is the standard design ✅
- FDE cycle is the basic operation cycle ✅
- Performance depends on cores, cache, and clock speed ✅
