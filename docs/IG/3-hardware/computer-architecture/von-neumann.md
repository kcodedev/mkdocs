Most computers follow the Von Neumann architecture, which includes:

  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (ALU): Performs mathematical and logical operations
  - **Control Unit** (CU): Directs the operation of the processor
  - **Registers**: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU
  - **Buses**: Pathways for data transfer (address bus, data bus, control bus)

## Key Principles

The Von Neumann architecture is based on several core principles:

- **Stored-Program Concept**: Programs and data are stored in the same memory, allowing the computer to modify its own instructions. This enables flexibility and programmability.
- **Sequential Processing**: Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed one at a time in a cycle.
- **Centralized Control**: A single control unit manages the flow of data and instructions.
- **Shared Memory**: Both data and instructions reside in the same memory space, accessed via buses.

**Interesting Fact**: The stored-program concept was a breakthrough because earlier computers like the ENIAC required manual rewiring for different programs. Von Neumann's design made computers reprogrammable electronically.

## Modern Relevance

Even today, most computers, from smartphones to supercomputers, are based on the Von Neumann architecture. Advances like multicore processors and memory hierarchies build upon this foundation. Emerging architectures, such as quantum computing, may eventually challenge it, but Von Neumann's design continues to influence computer science education and hardware development.
