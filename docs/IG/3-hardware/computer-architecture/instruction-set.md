# ðŸ“‹ Instruction Set

An instruction set is a collection of commands that the CPU can execute. These are machine code instructions that tell the CPU what operations to perform.

## Types of Instructions

Instruction sets typically include several categories of instructions:

- **Arithmetic Instructions**: Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Logical Instructions**: Handle bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
- **Data Transfer Instructions**: Move data between registers, memory, and I/O devices (e.g., LOAD, STORE).
- **Control Flow Instructions**: Manage program flow, including jumps, branches, and subroutine calls.
- **Input/Output Instructions**: Interact with external devices for data input and output.
