# âš¡ Performance Factors

Several factors affect CPU performance:

- **Cores**: Multiple processing units within a single CPU chip
- **Cache**: High-speed memory that stores frequently used data
- **Clock Speed**: The rate at which the CPU processes instructions

## Cores
Multiple cores allow parallel processing, enabling multitasking and improved performance for multi-threaded applications. For example, a quad-core CPU can handle four tasks simultaneously.

    F --> H[Thread 2: Part 2]
    F --> I[Thread 3: Part 3]
    F --> J[Thread 4: Part 4]
```

## Cache
Cache memory reduces access time to frequently used data. Cache is integrated directly onto the CPU and operates in multiple levels:

- **L1 Cache**: The smallest and fastest level, located closest to the CPU cores. Typically 32-64 KB per core.
- **L2 Cache**: Larger than L1 but slower, usually 256 KB to 1 MB per core.
- **L3 Cache**: The largest level, shared among all cores on the CPU. Can be several MB, slowest but helps with data sharing between cores.

This hierarchy ensures that frequently accessed data is available with minimal delay.

        Memory-->>Cache: Return Data
        Cache-->>CPU: Return Data
    end
```

## Clock Speed
Measured in GHz, it indicates cycles per second. Higher clock speeds mean faster instruction execution, but heat and power consumption increase.
