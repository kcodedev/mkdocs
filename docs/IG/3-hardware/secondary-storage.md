# 💽 Secondary Storage

Secondary storage provides permanent storage that the CPU accesses indirectly:

### Magnetic Storage
- Uses platters coated with magnetic material
- Data read/written using electromagnets
- Example: Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

### Optical Storage
- Uses lasers to create pits and lands on discs
- Data read by detecting light reflection
- Examples: CD, DVD, Blu-ray

### Solid-State Storage (Flash Memory)
- Uses NAND or NOR technology
- Transistors act as control gates and floating gates
- Examples: SSD, USB drives, SD cards
