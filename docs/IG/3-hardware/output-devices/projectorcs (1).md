## _Liquid Crystal Display Projectors_ 💧

Liquid Crystal Display Projector is also known as **LCD projectors**. They are a type of video projector that uses Liquid Crystal Display panels to create and project an image onto a screen.



_**Step-by-step how LCD projectors work:**_

1. Starts off with a powerful lamp that creates white light.

2. It is sent to dichroic mirrors to splith the white light into seperate red, green and blue beams.

3. The color beams pass through their own liquid crystal display screens.

4. Each screens are made of thousands of tiny pixel that either block light or let it through. _This produces a **monochromatic** image._

5. The three color beams now carry its own grayscale image which pass through a prism to make a full color image.

6. Finally, the image passes through the projector lens onto a screen.

## _Digital Light Projectors_ 💡

**Digital Micromirror device (DMD)** are used by Digital Light Projectors (DLP).

_**Step-by-step how DLP work:**_

1. A bright white light passes through a color filter.

2. The white light is split into three primary colors: blue, red and green.

3. Electronic signals control each mirror on the DMD panel to tilt or adjust the lens so that different colors can be made.

4. Mirrors on the DMD panel switches on and off rapidly to control the brightness of each pixel. 

         (The faster the mirror is on, the brighter the pixel is)

5. Finally, the lens projects each pixel onto a screen, which creates a clear image.

 _**What is Greyscale Image?**_

- The numbers of micromirrors and the way they are arranged affect the quality of the image.

- When the mirror tilts towards the light source, that means it’s ON. 

- When the mirror tilts away from the light source, that means it’s OFF.

- The micromirrors can switch on and off to create a variety of different shades of grey. (typically 1024 shades)

## Advantages **VS** Disadvantages of both projectors 👍👎

| **Projectors** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|:---------------|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| LCD Projectors | Better image quality _(brighter colors, smoother visuals, high accuracy)_ | Lower contrast ratio _(can't display dark tones as well as others)_ |
|                | More energy efficent _(consumes less power)_ | Have a limited life _(not as good as DLPs)_ |
|                | Generates less heat | Requires a lot of care _(cleaning frequently, replacing parts, etc)_ |
| Digital Light Projectors (DLP)| Higher contrast ratios | Color vibrancy and definition is not as good as LCD Projectors because the color saturation isn't as good |
|                | More durable _(Better for dusty or smoky atmospheres)_ | Doesn't have grey components  |
|                | Lighter and smaller than LCD Projectors | Screen door effect _(Grid pattern of pixels can be visible, mostly upclose)_ |
|                | Uses a single DMD chip _(has no issue lining up images) | Images has problems from 'shadows' when projecting a moving image |
|                | Runs quiter than LCD Projectors |  |
