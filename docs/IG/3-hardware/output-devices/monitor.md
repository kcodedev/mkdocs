# Monitors

There are many different types of monitors. We will cover 3 types: LED, LCD, and OLED monitors


## 💎 LCD Screens

LCD (Liquid-Crystal Display) is a type of flat-panel display technology (lightweight, thin, electric display) used commonly in daily life.


### 🤓 Structure, layers, and how they work

* It uses liquid crystals to produce images 
* Backlight from the monitor shines through it and passes through the RGB filter which gives the image colour 
* First polarizer forces the light to vibrate in one direction
* Second polarizer controls how much of the light gets to pass through 
* The electrodes are switches that control the liquid crystal in each pixel.

### 😀 Advantages

* Lightweight, space-saving design

* Cheaper than OLED screens

* They can last 10-15 years!!!

### 😣 Disadvantages

* OLED screens are generally better than LCD screens because they emit less blue light. LCD hurts your eyes more than OLED screens.
* (Monitor) needs to be plugged to computer

* Looking at the screen at a different angle can make the screen’s display look disorted.

## 💡LED  Screens

An LED (Light-Emitting Diode) screen is a display technology that uses tiny light-emitting diodes to produce images, videos, and texts. Here's what an LED screen looks like very close up.

### How it works

* Each diode emits its own colour
* The screen can be back-lit
* Shades of colour are made by mixing red, blue, and green

### Advantages

* Energy efficient, environmentally friendly 
* High resolution, no flicker, vivid colours
* Thin display

### Disadvantages

* Pricey/Expensive
* Limited colour contrast (compared to OLED)
* Overheating can shorten the lifespans of LED screens


## 🌈 OLED Screens

OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screens use a self-emmisive display technology. Each pixel produces its own light, producing top-tier, high-resolution image and video quality. It is used in top-tier monitors and TVs.

### Layers:

### 💻 How it works:

* Each little diode (subpixel) emits its own light
* Light-emitting layers made of organic compounds
* Glass substrate: structural base of display
* Anode: puts positive charge into organic layer
* Conductive Layer: Moves positive charge into organic emissive layer
* Organic Emissive Layer: Where RGB light is generated
* Cathode: puts negative charge into organic layer

### 😍😍😍 Advantages

* True black, great quality, great image depth
* Thin, light, portable
* Fast response time, great viewing angles

### 😔💔🥀 Disadvantages

* Expensive 💵💲💳
* Limited Lifespan
* Burn in (images can leave permanent marks if displayed for too long)


## Past Paper questions

*2020 0478 Paper 11 O/N*

Question 8:

(a) Explain what is meant by LED Technology [3 marks]

    Mark Scheme:

    − Light emitting diodes (technology)
    − The display is made up of pixels
    − … that are arranged together as a matrix
    − … each is formed of three LEDs/filters
    − Shades of colour are achieved by mixing red, blue and green
    − The screen can be back-lit/edge-lit
    NOTE: Use of liquid crystals with LED technology can also be awarded 

(b) State 3 benefits of LED Technology [3 marks]

    Mark Scheme:

    Any three from:

    − Energy efficient // low power consumption
    − Long lasting // longevity
    − Focussed beam // less light strays from beam
    − Brighter/vivid colours
    − High resolution
    − No flicker
    − Display is thinner
    − Mercury free technology // environmentally friendly
    − Fewer pixel failure
    − Increased viewing in sunlight
