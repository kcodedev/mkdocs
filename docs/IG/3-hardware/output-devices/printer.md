# 🖨Printers: An output device which creates hard copies

## What is it and what does it do?
A printer is an output device which converts electronic data into a physical copy of texts and grpahics usually on a physical medium- something that carries information- like paper. The 3 main types of printer are : **Inkjet**, **Laser** and **3D**.

## ↔ How do printers "Understand" data?
Although different types of printer have different "printing methods", they all have to covert electronic data into a form that the printer can understand and follow. For example Inkjet and laser printers translate documents into ***dot patterns*** while 3D printers change electronic data to ***G-code.***

## 💧 Inkjet printers:

Inkjet printers are the most common type of printer due to its affordability, high-quality color printing, and versatility. They use liquid ink catridges using colours CMYK (Cyan, Magneta, Yellow and Black). Below is more on how they work.

- The printer turns the electronic data it recieved using its printer driver, which turns the file into a dot pattern (bitmap) that the printer can understand.

- After that, thousands of microscopic nozzles from a printhead precisely propel out microscopic droplets of liquid ink onto the paper where its needed according to the bitmap.

- This creates a patterns of dots resulting in an image.

## ☄️ Laser printers: 

Laser printers are a type of printer that uses a laser beam to produce high-quality text and images on paper. Laser printers are known for their speed, precision, and efficiency, making them ideal for offices and high-volume printing tasks. Below is more on how they work.

- The printer’s processor turns data into a bitmap- similar to Inkjet- showing exactly where ink (toner) should go on the page.

- Inside the printer, there’s a drum that can hold an electrical charge.
A laser beam shines on it, drawing the bitmap pattern by removing charge in certain spots — like “painting” the page with light.

- The printer adds toner, a fine black (or colored) powder.
The toner sticks only to the laser-drawn parts of the drum.

- A sheet of paper rolls under the drum, and the toner image gets transferred onto the paper.

- The paper passes through hot rollers (called the fuser) that melt the toner so it sticks permanently to the paper.

##  💨3D printers: 

3D printers are machines that creates three-dimensional objects from digital designs. Instead of printing on paper like a normal printer, it builds objects layer by layer using materials like plastic, resin, or metal. Below is more on how it works.

- The design is converted into a file the printer can read, usually in STL or OBJ format, which slices the model into thin horizontal layers.

- Material is loaded into the printer. (plastic filament, resin, or metal powder)

- The printer solidifies or deposits the material layer by layer, the new one fusing to the previous layer. This builds the object from the ground up.

|Printer|Pros   |Cons   |
|--------|------|--------|
|Inkjet| High quality colour prints, affordable for home use| Slow for large volume printing, the ink can be costly
|Laser| Fast printing, low cost per page | Heavy and takes up alot of space
|3D| Can make complex 3D objects so is beneficial for models| Slow production and high cost of printer and materials
