In 3D printing objects are built up layer upon layer in a process referred to as **additive manufacturing**. 

## 3D Printing Process

🧊 A 3D model is created using CAD software and saved in formats like STL or OBJ.<br>
🥪 The model is sliced into thin horizontal layers using slicing software, ... <br>
🔢 ... which generates G-code instructions that the printer can understand and execute.<br>
🧵 Material (e.g., plastic filament, resin, or metal powder) is loaded into the printer.<br>
☀️ The filament is fed into a **heating element** that melts it...<br>
📥 ... then extruded through a **nozzle** layer by layer, each new layer fusing to the previous, ... <br>
🛠️ ... building the object from the bottom up.
