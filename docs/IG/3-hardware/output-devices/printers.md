## Types of Printer

| Printer Type | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|
| [Inkjet Printers](inkjet-printers.md) | Affordable, high-quality color printing for home and small office use. |
| [Laser Printers](laser-printers.md) | Fast, precise printing for offices and high-volume tasks. |
| [3D Printers](3d-printers.md) | Creating three-dimensional objects from digital designs. |

## How do printers "Understand" data?

Software on the computer converts documents into **dot patterns**—grids of tiny dots that represent text and images—for **inkjet** and **laser** printers. These patterns tell the printer exactly where to place ink or toner on the page.<br> 

Meanwhile, slicing software transforms 3D models into **G-code**, a set of instructions that guide the **3D printer** on how to move, layer by layer, and deposit material to build the object. All this processed data is then sent to the respective printers for execution.
