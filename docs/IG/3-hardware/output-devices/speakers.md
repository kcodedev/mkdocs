&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudspeakers are output devices that <span style="color: #311500ff; font-weight: bold;">produce sound</span>. When a speaker is connected to a computer the digital sound must be converted to analog.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a sound is stored in a computer, it first must <span style="color: #311500ff; font-weight: bold;">go through a DAC</span> (Digital-to-Analogue converter) to convert <span style="color: #311500ff;">digital (binary) data into analogue</span> (electric current) that can power the speaker.

### <span style="color: #311500ff; font-weight: bold;">Amplifier</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It then needs to go through an amplifier to <span style="color: #311500ff; font-weight: bold;">amplify the signal (electric current)</span> generated by the DAC, which is very small. This current will be powerful enough to <span style="color: #311500ff; font-weight: bold;">drive a loudspeaker.</span>

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core becomes a <span style="color: #311500ff;">temporary electromagnet</span> when an electric current flows through the coil of wire that is wrapped around an iron core. A permanent magnet is also positioned very close to this electromagnet.
­  
-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <span style="color: #311500ff;">induced magnetic field</span> in the iron core also varies as the electric current through the coil of wire varies. This makes the iron core to be attracted towards the permanent magnet and because the current varies, this will also cause the iron core to <span style="color: #311500ff;">vibrate</span>.
­
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the iron core is attached to a <span style="color: #311500ff;">cone</span> (made of paper or thin synthetic material), which makes the cone to vibrate, producing <span style="color: #311500ff;">sound waves</span> that we hear.
