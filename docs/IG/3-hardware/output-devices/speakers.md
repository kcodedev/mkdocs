## How a Speaker Works

🔊 Speakers convert electrical energy to acoustical energy, the opposite of mics<br>
🔊 Current flows through a **coil of wire** attached to a **cone** ... <br>
🔊 ... suspended within the magnetic field of a **permanent magnet**<br>
🔊 The direction of the current changes constantly causing the ... <br>
🔊 ...**diaphragm/cone** to move back and forth and produce sound waves <br>
🔊 The rate at which the current change determines the frequency (pitch) of the sound wave. <br>
🔊 The magnitude of the current determines the amplitude (volume).

## DAC in the big picture

­Sound stored in a computer must go through a **DAC** (Digital-to-Analogue converter) to convert digital (binary) data into analogue (electric current) that can power the speaker.
