# **Printers** 🖨
**Printers** are output devices that produces a physical version or a hard copy of text, images or other data that is stored on a laptop or computer. There are multiple types of printers (e.g. Inkjet and Laser), however they all work in similar ways. Both convert electronic data into something you can hold.

## **Inkjet Printers** 💧

<p> Inkjet printers are printers that uses wet ink to print data onto paper. These printers are usually made up of: </p>

* A print head that sprays the ink through a nozzle
* An ink cartridge that contains the ink.
* A stepper motor and belt for moving the print head and its accessories from side to side.
* A paper feed where you place paper for printing. This can be any size depending on the size of the printer.

### **How Ink Droplets Are Produced**

Ink droplets are produced by two different technologies:

**1. Thermal Bubbles** - tiny resistors that create heat, making the ink heat up and slowly vaporise. This causes the ink to form a bubble that expands due to the heat. Because of this, some of the ink is released from the print head onto the paper. When the bubble collapses, a small vacuum is created, allowing fresh ink to be brought into the print head. This continues repeatedly until the printing cycle is completed.

**2. Piezoelectric** - a crystal that is located at the back of the ink reservoir (e.g. in the ink cartridge) for each nozzle. The crystal is given a tiny electric charge, making it vibrate. This vibration forces ink to be ejected onto the paper; at the same time more ink is drawn in for further printing.

### **The Process of the Inkjet Printing**

This is how a document is sent to an inkjet printer for printing:

**1.** The data from the document is sent to a printer driver.

**2.** The printer driver makes sure that the data recieved is in a format that the printer can understand it well.

**3.** A check is then made by the printer driver to make sure that the printer is available to print the data. For instance, it might check if the printer is busy, offline, out of ink, and so on and so on.

**4.** The data is then sent to the printer and it is stored temporarily in memory known as a printer buffer.

**5.** A sheet of paper is then given into the main body of the printer where a sensor then detects whether paper is available or not in the paper feed tray.
If it is out of paper or the paper is jammed or if there is an error, then an error message is sent back to the computer with the problem the printer recieved.

**6.** As the sheet of paper is going through the printer, the print head moves from side to side across the paper, printing the text or image. The four ink colours provided are sprayed exact amounts to produce the required colour. 


**7.** At the end of each full pass of the print head, the paper is moved very slightly to allow the next line to be printed. This continues repeatedly until the whole page has been printed.

**8.** If there is more data in the printer buffer, the temporary data in the printer, then the whole process continues from Step 5 until the buffer is
finally empty.

**9.** Once the printer buffer is has been emptied, the printer sends an interrupt, a signal from the printer, to the CPU in the computer, requesting for more data to be sent to the printer. This whole process then continues until the whole of the document has been fully printed.

<br>
No matter what technology you use, these basic steps are usually the same!

### **Uses for Inkjet Printing**

Inkjet printers are usually used for printing one-off photos or where only a few pages of good quality colour printing is needed. The small ink cartridges or small paper trays would not be an issue with such
uses.

## **Laser Printers** 🔴

**Laser printers** use dry powder ink instead of wet ink and use different properties of static electricity to produce text and images. Unlike inkjet
printers, laser printers print the document/page at once. Colour laser printers usually use 4 toner cartridges (similar to ink cartridges but for laser printers): 
* **Blue**
* **Cyan**
* **Magenta**
* **Black**

The technology is different to monochrome printers (black and white), the printing method is similar. However, coloured dots are used to make the text and images.

### <span style="color:#FC0000">**The Process of Laser Printing**</span>

This is how a laser printer prints a page:

**1.** The data from the document is sent to a printer driver in the laser printer.

**2.** The printer driver makes sure that the data is in a format that the  printer can understand.

**3.** A check is made by the printer driver to make sure that the printer is available and ready to print.

**4.** The data is sent to the printer and it is stored in a temporary memory called a printer buffer.

**5.** The start of the printing process involves a printing drum being given a positive charge. this drum rotates, then a laser beam is scanned across it, removing the positive charge in certain areas. This leaves negatively charged areas that exactly match the text/images of the page to be printed.

**6.** The drum is then coated with positively charged toner (powdered ink); since the toner is positively charged, it only sticks to the negatively charged parts of the drum.

**7.** A negatively charged sheet of paper is rolled over the drum.

**8.** The toner on the drum sticks to the paper to produce an exact copy of the page sent to the printer.

**9.** To prevent the paper sticking to the drum, the electric charge on the sheet of paper is removed after one rotation of the drum.

**10.** The paper goes through a fuser which is a set of heated rollers. The heat melts the ink, fixing it permanently to the sheet of paper.

**11.** At the end, a discharge lamp removes all the electric charges from the drum. This makes it ready to print out the next page.

### **Uses for Laser Printing**

Laser printers produce high quality printouts that are very fast
when making multiple copies of a document. Any application that needs high
volume printing (in colour or black and white) would choose the laser printer. Laser printers have two advantages: they have big toner
cartridges and large paper trays.

## <span style="color:#00FFFF">**3D Printers**</span> 🔭

If you didn't already know, 3D printers are used to make solid 3D objects that actually work. They are based from inkjet and laser printing technology. Layer by layer, the object is produced using substances and materials like: powdered resin, powdered metal, paper or ceramic.

Some key terms you <span style="color:#39FF14">**need**</span> to know:

<span style="color:#39FF14">**Direct 3D Printing**</span> - it uses inkjet technology. The print head can move left to right like in a normal printer. However, the print head can move up and down to build up the layers of an object as it gets bigger. Mr. Kieran has one in his room now!

<span style="color:#39FF14">**Binder 3D Printing**</span> - it is similar to direct 3D printing but has two passes (movements) for each of the layers. The first pass sprays dry powder and then on the second pass a binder (a type of glue) is sprayed to form a solid layer.

### <span style="color:#00FFFF">**The Process of 3D Printing**</span>

**1.** A design is created using a computer aided design (CAD) software.

**2.** The finalised design is imported into a special software that
prepares it in a format that the 3D printer can understand.

**3.** The 3D printer is then set up to allow the solid object to be made.

**4.** The solid object is built up layer by layer (often only 0.1 mm thick). The process can take several hours depending on the thickness of the layers, the material used and the overall size of the final product.

**5.** The object is taken out of the printer and is prepared (e.g. some use a jelly-like support that needs to be washed away, or some require the removal of excess plastic powder) In some cases, the object has to be left to ‘cure’ for a few hours.

### **Uses of 3D Printing**

3D printing might be considered as the next 'industrial revolution' as it will change manufacturing methods in several industries. For instance, it might be used in healthcare to cover prosthetic limbs to make it fit the limb.
