**LCD projectors** are a type of video projector that use Liquid Crystal Display panels to create and project an image onto a screen.



_**Step-by-step how LCD projectors work:**_

1. White light is produced by a powerful lamp
2. Light is split into red, green, and blue beams using dichroic mirrors
3. Each color beam passes through its own liquid crystal display panel
4. Pixels in the panels block or allow light to create grayscale images
5. The beams are combined using a prism to form a full color image
6. The image is projected through a lens onto a screen

## _Digital Light Projectors_ 💡

**Digital Micromirror device (DMD)** are used by Digital Light Projectors (DLP).

_**Step-by-step how DLP work:**_

1. Colours are produced using a (colour wheel) to filter light into RGB
2. Uses a large number of tiny mirrors laid out in a grid
3. Each mirror creates a pixel in the image
4. Mirrors can tilt away or toward the light source
5. To reflect light toward/away from the projection lens
6. The projection lens focuses the light onto the screen to display the image



## Advantages and Disadvantages of LCD and DLP Projectors

| **Projectors** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|:---------------|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| LCD Projectors | Better image quality _(brighter colors, smoother visuals, high accuracy)_ | Lower contrast ratio _(can't display dark tones as well as others)_ |
|                | More energy efficent _(consumes less power)_ | Have a limited life _(not as good as DLPs)_ |
|                | Generates less heat | Requires a lot of care _(cleaning frequently, replacing parts, etc)_ |
| Digital Light Projectors (DLP)| Higher contrast ratios | Color vibrancy and definition is not as good as LCD Projectors because the color saturation isn't as good |
|                | More durable _(Better for dusty or smoky atmospheres)_ | Doesn't have grey components  |
|                | Lighter and smaller than LCD Projectors | Screen door effect _(Grid pattern of pixels can be visible, mostly upclose)_ |
|                | Uses a single DMD chip _(has no issue lining up images) | Images has problems from 'shadows' when projecting a moving image |
|                | Runs quiter than LCD Projectors |  |
