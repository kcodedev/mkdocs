# 🧠 Primary Storage

Primary storage holds data that the CPU can access **directly**:

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary storage for running programs and data
- **ROM (Read Only Memory)**: Permanent storage for system instructions and firmware

**Key Differences:**

- RAM is volatile (loses data when power is off)
- ROM is non-volatile (retains data without power)
- Both provide fast access for the CPU
