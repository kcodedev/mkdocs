## 📥 Input Devices

Input devices capture data and send it to the computer:

- **Keyboard**: Types text and commands
- **Mouse**: Points and clicks on screen elements
- **Touch Screen**: Responds to finger touches (resistive, capacitive, infrared)
- **Barcode Scanner**: Reads barcode patterns
- **Digital Camera**: Captures images
- **Microphone**: Records audio
- **2D/3D Scanners**: Create digital representations of objects
