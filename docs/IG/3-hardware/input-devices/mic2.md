## How a Microphone Works

🎤 Microphones convert acoustical energy to electrical energy <br>
🎤 Most mics use a **diaphragm**, a thin material that vibrates when hit by sound waves <br>
🎤 The vibrating diaphragm  moves a coil past an electromagnet... <br>
🎤 ... allowing the sound vibrations to be converted to electrical current <br>
⚡ The electrical signal is then converted to digital (0️⃣1️⃣) using an ADC.
