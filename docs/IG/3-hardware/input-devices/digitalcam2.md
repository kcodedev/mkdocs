## 📸 Digital Camera

> There are countless digital camera models, brands, and types; most digital cameras record video along with images.

A digital camera captures images and stores them as **digital data** in memory cards. This allows instant previews and easy transfers to other devices via USB port or Bluetooth.

As an **input device**, it captures visual information and converts it so that a computer can process it.

## ⚙️ Parts of a Digital Camera:
- **lens**
- **electronic sensor**
- **analogue-to-digital converter** (ADC)
- **timing device** for shutter speed (how long the digital sensor is exposed to light)
- **digital storage** (memory card)

## 📸 How a Picture Is Taken

1. Light passes through the **lens** and meets the **sensor**, made up of tiny little mirrors (photodiodes) that converts it into electricity.

> Each mirror represents one **pixel**.

2. As tiny electric charges, the image then passes through an **analogue-to-digital converter** (ADC), which changes each pixel into levels of brightness and color.

> Most cameras use the **RGB** system, meaning each pixel would have a red, green, and blue value ranging from 0 to 255.

3. The quality of the image depends on the quality of the **camera lens** and **sensor**, the light levels, the amount of pixels used, and the file type the image is stored in.
