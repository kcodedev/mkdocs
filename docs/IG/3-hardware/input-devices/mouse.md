# Mouse
  A **Mouse** is a pointing device. It is a manual input device used with Graphical User Interface (GUI) to control the position of the **cursor** on the screen by simply moving the mouse over a surface.

# Optical Mouse 
  + An **Optical mouse** uses tiny cameras to take 1500 images per second. Unlike an older mechanical mouse, the optical mouse can work on virtually any surface. 
  + A LED is used in the base of the mouse and the red light is bounced off the surface and the reflection is picked up by the **Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)**. 
  + The CMOS generates electric pulses to represent the reflected red light and these pulses are sent to the **Digital Signal Processor (DSP)**. 
  + The processor can now work out the coordinates of the mouse based on the changing image patterns as it is moved about on the surface. 
  + The computer can then move the on-screen cursor to the coordinates sent by the mouse.

# &#128077; Advantages of Optical Mouse
  + There are no moving parts like a mechanical mouse, therefore it is more reliable.
  + Dirt can't get trapped in any of the mechanical components.
  + There is no need to have any special surfaces.
  + Greater precision and responsiveness, more accurate movement of the cursor.
  + Compact and lightweight, making it very portable.
# &#128078; Disadvantages of Optical Mouse
  + Some users may find it hard to control their cursor speed or accuracy with an optical mouse.
  + Might not work well on surfaces that are too glossy, transparent or uneven. These surfaces may reflect too much or too little light, causing misread of the light pattern and produce not stable cursor movements. 


# Difference of Wired and Wireless Mouse
  **An Optical Mouse can be either Wired or Wireless.**
| Wired Mouse | Wireless Mouse |
|---|---|
| USB Cable | Bluetooth or USB receiver |
| USB Port | Batteries or Rechargeable |
| Cheaper | More expensive|
| Less Portable with the cable | Highly Portable |
| More reliable | Can have interference issues |
