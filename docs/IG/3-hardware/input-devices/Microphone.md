> A microphone is a device that coverts sound waves (vibrations in air) into electrical signals.

## List of tips
- **Sound waves hit a diaphragm** (thin membrane).*
- **The diaphragm vibrates** according to the sound waves.
- **Vibrations are converted into an electrical signal**, which can be analog or digital.
- **The signal can then be amplified, recorded, or transmitted**.*

## Types of Microphones
1. **Dynamic Microphone**  
   - Durable, good for live performances, uses electromagnetic induction.  
2. **Condenser Microphone**  
   - Sensitive, ideal for studios, requires external power (phantom power).  
3. **Ribbon Microphone**  
   - Captures smooth, vintage sound, fragile, mostly for studio use.  
4. **Lavalier / Lapel Microphone**  
   - Small, clip-on, used in presentations or filming.

## Tips for Using a Microphone
1. Keep the microphone **close to the sound source** for clarity.  
2. Avoid **background noise** when recording.  
3. Use a **pop filter** to reduce plosive sounds (like "p" and "b").  
4. Handle **condenser microphones carefully**, as they are sensitive to impact.
