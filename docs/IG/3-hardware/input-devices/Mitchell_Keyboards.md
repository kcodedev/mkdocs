# Role of Keyboards


The role of a keyboard is to serve as an input device for users to enter text characters into a computer, and to interact with the computer.


# Components

# Different types


_Mechanical keyboards_ use individual switches for every key. They are very durable, often lasting for tens of millions of keypresses. They have very good responsiveness, and allow for a greater selection of sounds that your keys can make when pressed (Tactile, Linear, Quiet, Clicky, Creamy)

_Membrane keyboards_ use a silicone dome layer under the keycaps to register keypresses. They are usually quiet and are one of the more affordable options, but don’t have the best durability.

_Virtual keyboards_ are used by devices like phones and tablets.

_Hall Effect keyboards_ use magnetic sensors which allow for adjustable actuation times, faster response times, and very good durability.
