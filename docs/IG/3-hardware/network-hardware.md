# 🌐 Network Hardware: Connecting Devices

Network hardware enables communication between computers and devices. Key components include network interface cards, addresses, and routers that manage data flow across networks.

## 🖥️ Network Interface Card (NIC)

Every device needs a NIC to connect to a network:

- **Purpose**: Enables communication between device and network
- **Types**: Wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi)
- **Function**: Converts data into network signals and vice versa

---

## 🏷️ MAC Address

Each NIC has a unique identifier called a MAC address:

- **Structure**: 48-bit hexadecimal number (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
- **Components**: Manufacturer code + Serial number
- **Purpose**: Identifies devices on a local network
- **Assignment**: Set by manufacturer at production

---

## 📍 IP Address

IP addresses identify devices on the internet:

- **Purpose**: Routing data to correct destination
- **Types**:
  - **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
  - **IPv6**: 128-bit address for more devices
- **Assignment**: Static (fixed) or Dynamic (changes)
- **Allocation**: Managed by network router

## 🛤️ Router

Routers direct network traffic:

- **Functions**:
  - Sends data to specific destinations
  - Connects local networks to the internet
  - Assigns IP addresses to devices
  - Manages network security

**Router Capabilities:**
- **IP Assignment**: DHCP server functionality
- **Network Connection**: Gateway between LAN and internet
- **Traffic Management**: Routes packets efficiently

---

## 🔗 Network Communication Flow

1. Device sends data through NIC
2. Data packets include destination IP and MAC addresses
3. Router receives packets and forwards to correct destination
4. Receiving device processes the data

## 📝 **Key Points:**

- NIC enables network connection ✅
- MAC address uniquely identifies hardware ✅
- IP address enables internet communication ✅
- Router manages network traffic ✅
