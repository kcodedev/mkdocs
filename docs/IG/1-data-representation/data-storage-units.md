# Data Storage Units 💾

Understanding how data storage is measured is essential in computing. Data is stored in units that represent different amounts of information. Below are the key units you need to know:

## Basic Units

| Unit    | Symbol | Description                                   |
|---------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Bit     | b      | The smallest unit of data (0 or 1)            |
| Nibble  | —      | 4 bits                                        |
| Byte    | B      | 8 bits                                        |

## Binary Prefixes

Larger amounts of data are measured using binary prefixes. Each unit is 1024 times larger than the previous one.

| Unit         | Symbol | Amount in Previous Unit         |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| Kibibyte     | KiB    | 1024 bytes                     |
| Mebibyte     | MiB    | 1024 kibibytes                 |
| Gibibyte     | GiB    | 1024 mebibytes                 |
| Tebibyte     | TiB    | 1024 gibibytes                 |
| Pebibyte     | PiB    | 1024 tebibytes                 |
| Exbibyte     | EiB    | 1024 pebibytes                 |


## Typical File Sizes

| Unit | Typical Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Kibibyte (KiB)** 📧 | A small email without attachments or a simple text file. |
| **Mebibyte (MiB)** 📸 | A high-resolution JPEG image or a short MP3 audio file. |
| **Gibibyte (GiB)** 🎬 | A full-length, high-definition movie or a typical USB flash drive. |
| **Tebibyte (TiB)** 🖥️ | The capacity of a modern computer hard drive. |
| **Pebibyte (PiB)** ☁️ | The storage for all photos on a large social media platform. |
| **Exbibyte (EiB)** 🌐 | The total storage capacity of major cloud providers like Google. |
