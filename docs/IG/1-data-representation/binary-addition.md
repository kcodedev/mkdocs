### **Adding Two Positive 8-Bit Binary Integers** âž•

Adding binary numbers is similar to adding denary numbers, but with just two digits: 0 and 1. You add from right to left, carrying over to the next column when the sum is 2 or more.

#### **The Rules for Binary Addition**

* `0 + 0 = 0`
* `0 + 1 = 1`
* `1 + 0 = 1`
* `1 + 1 = 10`
* `1 + 1 + 1 = 11`

### **How to Add Binary Numbers**

Let's add the two 8-bit binary integers: `01001011` and `00110010`.

We'll use a table to keep the place values and carries organized. We start from the rightmost column and work our way to the left.



| Carry over: | | | | | | | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| First Number: | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Second Number: | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **Sum:** | | | | | | | | |
