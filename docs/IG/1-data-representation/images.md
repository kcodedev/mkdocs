Hey there! üñºÔ∏è Ever wondered how your screen displays amazing pictures and stunning photos? It's all thanks to a simple yet powerful system of tiny building blocks called **pixels**.

A digital image is made up of a grid of these pixels, each one a single-colored dot. To represent an image, a computer converts each pixel's color into a unique binary code.

### üñºÔ∏è Resolution

The **resolution** of an image is the total number of pixels it contains, typically measured as width √ó height (e.g., 1920x1080).

* Think of it like a mosaic: the more tiles you have, the more detailed and larger your picture can be.
* A higher resolution means more pixels, which results in a sharper, clearer image.
* The trade-off is that more pixels means a **larger file size**! üíæ

### üé® Colour Depth

The **colour depth** is the number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel. This determines how many different colors can be displayed in an image.

* Imagine your color palette: with 1 bit, you can only have two colors (like black and white). With 8 bits, you get 256 colors. With 24 bits, you can have over 16 million colors!
* A higher color depth allows for a richer and more vibrant image with more shades and tones.
* Just like with resolution, more bits per pixel means a **larger file size**.



So, for a high-quality, high-resolution image with lots of vibrant colors, you need both a high resolution and a high color depth‚Äîbut be prepared for a much bigger file!
