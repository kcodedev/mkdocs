## 🙃 Common Misconceptions

> ❌ "The Internet and the Web are the same thing."

Not quite! Here's a breakdown of what people often mix up:

| Misconception 💭              | Reality ✅                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| The web **is** the internet   | The web **uses** the internet              |
| All internet activity is on the web | Email, file transfers, and gaming all use the internet but **not** the web |
| Turning off the web shuts down the internet | Nope — you can turn off web servers but the **network still runs** |

## 🎯 Quick Analogy

> Imagine the **internet** as a giant **transport system** (trains, tracks, and stations), and the **World Wide Web** as the **passenger service** (websites) that travels on it. You can still use the transport for shipping packages (emails, files) even if the passenger trains stop running.
