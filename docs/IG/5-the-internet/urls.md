# 🔗 Understanding URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)

## 🌍 What is a URL?

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is a **text-based address** used to locate a web page or file on the World Wide Web.

It tells your browser **where to go** and **how to get there**.

## 🧱 Parts of a URL

Here’s an example:

https://www.example.com/page.html


Let’s break it down:

- **🔐 Protocol**: `https://` – This tells the browser **how** to access the resource (HTTP or HTTPS).
- **🏠 Domain Name**: `www.example.com` – This tells the browser **where** the website is located (the server address).
- **📄 File Path**: `/page.html` – This specifies **what** page or file to load.

## 🔍 Quick Example

| Part          | Meaning                               |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `https://`    | Protocol (secure web access)           |
| `google.com`  | Domain name (Google's server)          |
| `/search`     | Specific resource or page being viewed |

## 🙃 Misconceptions

> ❌ “A URL is just a website name.”

Not quite! A domain like `example.com` is **part** of a URL, but a full URL may include much more — including folders, parameters, and anchors.

---

## 🛠️ Bonus Tip

Sometimes URLs also include:

- **🎯 Query strings**: `?q=chatgpt` (used for search and filtering)
- **🔖 Anchors**: `#section1` (to jump to a section of the page)
