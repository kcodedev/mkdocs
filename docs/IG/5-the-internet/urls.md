# 🔗 Understanding URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)

## 🌍 What is a URL?

A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is a **text-based address** used to locate a web page or file on the World Wide Web.

It tells your browser **where to go** and **how to get there**.

## 🧱 Parts of a URL

Here’s an example:

https://www.example.com/page.html


Let’s break it down:

- **🔐 Protocol**: `https://` – This tells the browser **how** to access the resource (HTTP or HTTPS).
- **🏠 Domain Name**: `www.example.com` – This tells the browser **where** the website is located (the server address).
- **📄 File Path**: `/page.html` – This specifies **what** page or file to load.

## 🔍 Quick Example

| Part          | Meaning                               |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `https://`    | Protocol (secure web access)           |
| `google.com`  | Domain name (Google's server)          |
| `/search`     | Specific resource or page being viewed |

## 🙃 Misconceptions

> ❌ “A URL is just a website name.”

Not quite! A domain like `example.com` is **part** of a URL, but a full URL may include much more — including folders, parameters, and anchors.

## 🛠️ Bonus Tip

Sometimes URLs also include:

- **🎯 Query strings**: `?q=chatgpt` (used for search and filtering)
- **🔖 Anchors**: `#section1` (to jump to a section of the page)

### 🔍 Query String Examples

**Search Query:**
```
https://www.google.com/search?q=python+tutorial
```
- `q=python+tutorial` - What you're searching for

**YouTube Video with Timestamp:**
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&t=60s
```
- `v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` - Video ID
- `t=60s` - Start playback at 60 seconds

### 🔖 Anchor Examples

**Wikipedia Section Link:**
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#History
```
- `#History` - Jumps directly to the "History" section

**Documentation Navigation:**
```
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-functions
```
- `#built-in-functions` - Scrolls to the built-in functions section
