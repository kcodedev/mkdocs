# 🛡️ Cyber Security Protection

We can protect data and systems using a variety of tools and practices:

### 🔐 Access Levels
- Restrict what users can see or do based on their roles.
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas of a system.

### 🛡️ Anti-Malware Software
- **Anti-virus**: Detects and removes viruses.
- **Anti-spyware**: Protects against spying software.

### 🔑 Authentication Methods
- **Username & Password**: Basic login credentials.
- **Biometrics**: Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Two-Step Verification (2FA)**: Adds a second layer, such as a code sent to your phone.

| Method | Pros | Cons | Security Level | Ease of Use |
|--------|------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Username & Password | Simple to implement; No special hardware required | Can be guessed or cracked; Vulnerable to phishing; Forgotten easily | Medium | High |
| Biometrics | Unique to individual; Convenient (no remembering needed) | Can be spoofed; Privacy concerns; Hardware dependent | High | High |
| Two-Step Verification (2FA) | Adds extra security layer; Protects against stolen passwords | Can be inconvenient; Requires second device; Vulnerable to SIM swapping | High | Medium |

### 🔐 Strong Passwords
- **What it is**: A password that is hard for attackers to guess or crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- Use at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common words, personal information (like birthdays or names), or simple patterns.
- Use a unique password for each account to prevent breaches from affecting multiple services.

### 🧐 Communication Awareness
- Be alert for suspicious spelling, grammar, or unusual tone.
- Don't trust messages asking for urgent action or sensitive information.

### 🔗 Link Safety
- Hover over links to check the **actual URL** before clicking.
- Be cautious of shortened or suspicious links.

### 🔏 Privacy Settings
- Use settings to control what information apps or websites collect.
- Reduces exposure to unwanted tracking or data harvesting.

### 🔐 SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
- Encrypts data between your browser and websites (look for 🔒 or "https").
- Keeps sensitive data like passwords and payment info safe.
