# 🛡️ Cyber Security Protection

We can protect data and systems using a variety of tools and practices:

### 🔐 Access Levels
- Restrict what users can see or do based on their roles.
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas of a system.

### 🛡️ Anti-Malware Software
- **Anti-virus**: Detects and removes viruses.
- **Anti-spyware**: Protects against spying software.

### 🔑 Authentication Methods
- **Username & Password**: Basic login credentials.
- **Biometrics**: Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Two-Step Verification (2FA)**: Adds a second layer, such as a code sent to your phone.

### 🔐 Strong Passwords
- **What it is**: A password that is hard for attackers to guess or crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- Use at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common words, personal information (like birthdays or names), or simple patterns.
- Use a unique password for each account to prevent breaches from affecting multiple services.
