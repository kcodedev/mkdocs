## 🛡️ Cyber Security Measures

We can protect data and systems using a variety of tools and practices:

### 🔐 Access Levels
- Restrict what users can see or do based on their roles.
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive areas of a system.

### 🛡️ Anti-Malware Software
- **Anti-virus**: Detects and removes viruses.
- **Anti-spyware**: Protects against spying software.

### 🔑 Authentication Methods
- **Username & Password**: Basic login credentials.
- **Biometrics**: Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition.
- **Two-Step Verification (2FA)**: Adds a second layer, such as a code sent to your phone.

### 🔄 Automated Software Updates
- Ensures known vulnerabilities are patched quickly without user effort.

### 🧐 Communication Awareness
- Be alert for suspicious spelling, grammar, or unusual tone.
- Don't trust messages asking for urgent action or sensitive information.

### 🔗 Link Safety
- Hover over links to check the **actual URL** before clicking.
- Be cautious of shortened or suspicious links.

### 🔥 Firewalls
- Software or hardware that monitors and controls network traffic.
- Blocks unauthorized access and potential threats.

### 🔏 Privacy Settings
- Use settings to control what information apps or websites collect.
- Reduces exposure to unwanted tracking or data harvesting.

### 🌐 Proxy Servers
- Acts as a gateway between your device and the internet.
- Can hide your IP address and filter web traffic.

### 🔐 SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
