### Methods of Data Transmission 🔌

Now let's look at the different ways data can be sent.

#### A. Serial vs. Parallel 🚦

- **Serial Transmission** ➡️: Data is sent **one bit at a time** along a single wire or channel.
  - **Advantage 👍**: It's reliable over long distances because there's less chance of the bits getting mixed up.
  - **Disadvantage 👎**: It's slower because each bit has to wait its turn.
- **Parallel Transmission** ➡️➡️➡️: Data is sent **multiple bits at a time** along several parallel wires.
  - **Advantage 👍**: It's much faster because all bits arrive at the same time.
  - **Disadvantage 👎**: It's unreliable over long distances. The bits can get "out of sync," leading to something called **data skew**. It's best for short distances, like within a computer.
