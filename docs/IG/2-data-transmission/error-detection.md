### Why We Need Error Detection 🚨

Imagine you're sending a message and part of it gets jumbled on the way. The person receiving it wouldn't be able to understand the message correctly. The same thing can happen with digital data. **Errors can occur during data transmission** due to **interference**. This can lead to:

-   **Data loss**: A piece of data goes missing.
-   **Data gain**: Extra, incorrect data is added.
-   **Data change**: A piece of data is altered from its original form.

To ensure the data is received exactly as it was sent, we need error detection methods.
