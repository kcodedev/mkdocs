  - **Hot-Swapping**: You can plug in and unplug devices while the computer is on without causing issues.
- **Drawbacks** 👎:
  - **Speed Limitations**: While faster versions exist (like USB 3.0 and 4.0), they can still be slower than other interfaces like Thunderbolt for very high-speed tasks.
  - **Distance Limitations**: USB cables have a maximum effective length, typically around 5 meters, before the signal degrades.
