#### B. Directional Transmission 🛣️

- **Simplex** unidirectionaI transmission ➡️: Data can only be sent in **one direction**. Think of a radio broadcast—the signal goes from the station to your radio, but not the other way around.
  - **Suitability**: Ideal for scenarios where a one-way communication is sufficient.
- **Half-Duplex** ↔️: Data can be sent in **both directions**, but **not at the same time**. A walkie-talkie is a perfect example—one person talks, then the other.
  - **Suitability**: Useful for scenarios where two-way communication is needed but not simultaneously.
- **Full-Duplex** ↕️: Data can be sent in **both directions simultaneously**. A regular phone call is a great example—both people can talk at the same time.
  - **Suitability**: Best for scenarios requiring continuous, two-way communication.
