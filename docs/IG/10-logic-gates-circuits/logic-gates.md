In this chapter you must learn the gates in the table below. You should also be able to combine these gates with each other and the NOT gate to form circuits. You should be able to draw the circuits, or produce a truth table for a given circuit. Some problems will be presented in word form.

| A | B | AND | OR | NAND | NOR | XOR |
