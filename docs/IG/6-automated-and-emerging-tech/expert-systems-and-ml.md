Two important types of Artificial Intelligence are **Expert Systems** and **Machine Learning**. Let’s see how they differ!


---

## 📚 Expert Systems

- Have a **knowledge base** — a collection of facts and information
  - Built by consulting domain experts to gather specialized knowledge and facts about the problem area
- Use a **rule base** — if-then rules to make decisions
  - Developed by interviewing experts to formulate logical if-then rules based on their experience and reasoning
- Use an **inference engine** — to apply rules and reach conclusions
  - Programmed as a reasoning component that applies the rules to the knowledge base to draw inferences and solve problems
- Provide an **interface** — so users can interact with the system
  - Designed with user-friendly input/output mechanisms to allow non-experts to query the system and receive explanations

Think of it like a smart advisor that follows strict rules to give answers!

- Example: Early chess AIs like Deep Thought (predecessor to Deep Blue) were built as expert systems, consulting grandmasters to encode chess knowledge and strategies into rules.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- Programs that **automatically adapt** by learning from data
  - Built using algorithms (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) that analyze large datasets to find patterns and make predictions
- Improve their performance without being explicitly programmed for every case
  - Developed through iterative training processes where the model adjusts based on feedback from data to handle new scenarios
- Change their own processes or data based on experience
  - Implemented with techniques like supervised or unsupervised learning, refining behavior through repeated exposure and optimization

It’s like a student that learns and gets better over time!

- Example: AlphaZero, developed by Google DeepMind, uses machine learning to learn chess from scratch through self-play, without relying on human-encoded rules.

## ✅ Summary

| Feature         | Expert Systems                     | Machine Learning                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| How it works    | Uses fixed rules and knowledge    | Learns and adapts from data             |
| Flexibility     | Limited to rules programmed       | Can handle new, unseen situations       |
| Example use     | Medical diagnosis based on rules  | Spam email filtering using patterns     |
