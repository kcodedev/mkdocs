# 🤖 Expert Systems vs Machine Learning

Two important types of Artificial Intelligence are **Expert Systems** and **Machine Learning**. Let’s see how they differ!

---

## 📚 Expert Systems

- Have a **knowledge base** — a collection of facts and information
- Use a **rule base** — if-then rules to make decisions
- Use an **inference engine** — to apply rules and reach conclusions
- Provide an **interface** — so users can interact with the system

Think of it like a smart advisor that follows strict rules to give answers!

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- Programs that **automatically adapt** by learning from data
- Improve their performance without being explicitly programmed for every case
- Change their own processes or data based on experience

It’s like a student that learns and gets better over time!

## ✅ Summary

| Feature         | Expert Systems                     | Machine Learning                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| How it works    | Uses fixed rules and knowledge    | Learns and adapts from data             |
| Flexibility     | Limited to rules programmed       | Can handle new, unseen situations       |
| Example use     | Medical diagnosis based on rules  | Spam email filtering using patterns     |

Both are powerful tools in AI with different strengths! ⚙️✨
