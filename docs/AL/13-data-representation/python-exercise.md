# Floating-Point Converter Problem

**Task:**  
Write a Python program to convert a binary floating-point number into its decimal value.

The floating-point representation has:

- **6 bits for the mantissa** (two’s complement)
- **4 bits for the exponent** (two’s complement)

Your program should:

1. Extract the mantissa and exponent from the binary input.
2. Convert the exponent from binary (two’s complement) to an integer.
3. Apply the exponent to shift the binary point left or right.
4. Output the final denary value.

## Step-by-Step Guidance

### Step 1 — Convert the exponent
- Take the last 4 bits as the exponent.
- Convert from binary to decimal using two’s complement rules.

### Step 2 — Position the binary point
- Take the first 6 bits as the mantissa.
- Interpret using two’s complement rules.
- Place the binary point immediately after the sign bit.
- Shift the point left or right depending on the exponent value.

### Step 3 — Calculate the decimal value
- Combine the mantissa and exponent to get the final number in decimal form.

**Example to test:**  
Binary input: `0110101110`

- Mantissa bits: `011010`
- Exponent bits: `1110`

Denary output: 
The exponent value of -2 tells us to shift the decimal point in the binary mantissa two places to the left.

- Original binary mantissa: `0.11010`
- Shifted binary number: `0.0011010`

Multiply the 1's by their place value and sum to get `0.203125`
