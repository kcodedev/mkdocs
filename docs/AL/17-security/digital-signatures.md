## Benefits of Digital Signatures

- **Authenticity**: Confirms the signer's identity via the certificate.
- **Integrity**: Detects any changes to the message.
- **Non-repudiation**: The signer cannot deny having signed the message, as only their private key could have created the signature.

Digital signatures are widely used in legal documents, financial transactions, software distribution, and secure communications.
