# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Introduction

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, the algorithm is widely used in network routing, GPS navigation systems, and various optimization problems in computer science.
