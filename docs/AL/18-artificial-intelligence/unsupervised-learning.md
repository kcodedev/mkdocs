# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns or structures without explicit guidance. The goal is to find inherent groupings or relationships in the data.

### Characteristics

- **Training Data**: Unlabeled dataset with only inputs
- **Goal**: Discover underlying structure or patterns
- **Evaluation**: Subjective, based on usefulness of discovered patterns

### Common Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into k clusters
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds nested clusters
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks for feature learning
- **Association Rule Mining**: Finds relationships between variables

### Applications

- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Data compression
- Topic modeling in text

### Advantages

- Can work with large amounts of unlabeled data
- Discovers unexpected patterns
- No need for expensive labeling

### Disadvantages

- Results can be subjective and hard to evaluate
- May find spurious patterns
- Requires domain knowledge to interpret results
