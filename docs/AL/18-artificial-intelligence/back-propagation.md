# Backpropagation

## Introduction

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is the primary algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network's weights, enabling the use of gradient descent optimization to minimize the error. This algorithm is fundamental to the success of deep learning and allows neural networks to learn complex patterns from data.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Chain Rule

Backpropagation relies heavily on the chain rule of calculus, which allows us to compute the derivative of composite functions. For a function f(g(x)), the derivative is f'(g(x)) * g'(x).

### Gradient Descent

The goal is to minimize the loss function L by adjusting the weights w:

w_new = w_old - η * ∂L/∂w

Where η is the learning rate.

## The Backpropagation Algorithm

### Forward Pass

1. Input data flows through the network
2. Each neuron computes its output using: output = activation(weighted_sum + bias)
3. Final output is compared to the target to compute the loss

### Backward Pass

1. **Compute output layer error**: δ_L = ∂L/∂a_L * σ'(z_L)
   - Where a_L is the activation of the output layer
   - z_L is the weighted input to the output layer
   - σ' is the derivative of the activation function

2. **Propagate error backwards**: For each hidden layer l:
   δ_l = (w_{l+1}^T * δ_{l+1}) ⊙ σ'(z_l)
   - w_{l+1}^T is the transpose of the weight matrix to the next layer
   - ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication

3. **Compute gradients**: ∂L/∂w_l = δ_l * a_{l-1}^T
   - a_{l-1} is the activation of the previous layer

4. **Update weights**: w_l = w_l - η * ∂L/∂w_l

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Forward Propagation

For each layer l from 1 to L:
- z_l = w_l * a_{l-1} + b_l
- a_l = σ(z_l)

Where:
- z_l: weighted input to layer l
- a_l: activation of layer l
- w_l: weight matrix for layer l
- b_l: bias vector for layer l
- σ: activation function

### Step 2: Compute Loss

L = (1/2) * ||y - a_L||²  (for mean squared error)

### Step 3: Backward Propagation

**Output Layer (l = L):**
- δ_L = (a_L - y) ⊙ σ'(z_L)

**Hidden Layers (l = L-1 down to 1):**
- δ_l = (w_{l+1}^T * δ_{l+1}) ⊙ σ'(z_l)

### Step 4: Compute Gradients

For each layer l:
- ∂L/∂w_l = δ_l * a_{l-1}^T
- ∂L/∂b_l = δ_l

### Step 5: Update Parameters

w_l = w_l - η * ∂L/∂w_l
b_l = b_l - η * ∂L/∂b_l

## Example: Simple Neural Network

Consider a network with:
- Input layer: 2 neurons
- Hidden layer: 2 neurons (sigmoid activation)
- Output layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)

**Forward Pass:**
- Input: x = [0.5, 0.8]
- Hidden: z_h = w_h * x + b_h = [0.1, 0.3] (example values)
- a_h = σ(z_h) = [0.525, 0.574]
- Output: z_o = w_o * a_h + b_o = 0.2
- a_o = σ(z_o) = 0.549
- Target: y = 1.0
- Loss: L = 0.5 * (1.0 - 0.549)² = 0.102

**Backward Pass:**
- δ_o = (0.549 - 1.0) * σ'(0.2) = (-0.451) * 0.247 = -0.111
- δ_h = w_o^T * δ_o ⊙ σ'(z_h) = [0.4, 0.6] * (-0.111) ⊙ [0.247, 0.241] = [-0.044, -0.067] ⊙ [0.247, 0.241] = [-0.011, -0.016]

**Gradient Computation:**
- ∂L/∂w_o = δ_o * a_h^T = [-0.111] * [0.525, 0.574] = [-0.058, -0.064]
- ∂L/∂w_h = δ_h * x^T = [-0.011, -0.016] * [0.5, 0.8] = [[-0.006, -0.009], [-0.008, -0.013]]

## Variants and Improvements

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

- Updates weights after each training example
- Faster convergence, but noisier updates

### Mini-batch Gradient Descent

- Compromise between batch and stochastic GD
- Updates after processing a small batch of examples

### Momentum

- Adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update
- Helps escape local minima and speeds up convergence

### Adam Optimizer

- Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- Combines momentum and RMSProp

## Challenges

### Vanishing Gradients

- Gradients become extremely small in deep networks
- Solutions: Use ReLU activation, batch normalization, residual connections

### Exploding Gradients

- Gradients become extremely large
- Solutions: Gradient clipping, weight initialization techniques

### Local Minima

- Optimization can get stuck in suboptimal solutions
- Solutions: Multiple random initializations, advanced optimizers

## Implementation Considerations

### Weight Initialization

- Poor initialization can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients
- Techniques: Xavier/Glorot initialization, He initialization

### Learning Rate Scheduling

- Start with higher learning rate, decrease over time
- Helps fine-tune the model in later stages

### Regularization

- Prevents overfitting
- Techniques: L1/L2 regularization, dropout

## Code Example (Numpy Implementation)

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)

# Network architecture
input_size = 2
hidden_size = 3
output_size = 1

# Initialize weights and biases
W1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
b1 = np.zeros((1, hidden_size))
W2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size)
b2 = np.zeros((1, output_size))

# Training data
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

learning_rate = 0.1
epochs = 10000

for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    z1 = np.dot(X, W1) + b1
    a1 = sigmoid(z1)
    z2 = np.dot(a1, W2) + b2
    a2 = sigmoid(z2)
    
    # Backward pass
    dz2 = a2 - y
    dW2 = np.dot(a1.T, dz2)
    db2 = np.sum(dz2, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    
    dz1 = np.dot(dz2, W2.T) * sigmoid_derivative(a1)
    dW1 = np.dot(X.T, dz1)
    db1 = np.sum(dz1, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    
    # Update weights
    W2 -= learning_rate * dW2
    b2 -= learning_rate * db2
    W1 -= learning_rate * dW1
    b1 -= learning_rate * db1
```
