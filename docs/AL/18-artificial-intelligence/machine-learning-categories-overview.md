## Introduction

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized based on the type of learning they perform and the nature of the training data available. These categories help in understanding which algorithms are suitable for different types of problems and data characteristics. The main categories are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, with additional subcategories and hybrid approaches.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised

## Comparison of Categories

| Aspect | Supervised | Unsupervised | Reinforcement |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Data | Labeled | Unlabeled | Sequential interactions |
| Goal | Prediction | Discovery | Optimal policy |
| Evaluation | Accuracy | Usefulness | Cumulative reward |
| Examples | Classification, Regression | Clustering, PCA | Game playing, Control |
| Data Requirements | High (labeled) | Low | Medium (environment interaction) |
| Interpretability | Often interpretable | Subjective | Policy-based |

## Hybrid Approaches

- **Supervised + Unsupervised**: Use clustering for feature engineering before supervised learning
- **Reinforcement + Supervised**: Imitation learning combines expert demonstrations with reinforcement
- **Transfer Learning**: Apply knowledge across categories
