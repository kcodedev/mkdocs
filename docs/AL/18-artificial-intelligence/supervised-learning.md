# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data, where each input example is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.

### Characteristics

- **Training Data**: Labeled dataset with input-output pairs
- **Goal**: Learn a function f(x) = y that maps inputs to outputs
- **Evaluation**: Compare predictions against known correct answers

### Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-based classification and regression
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds optimal hyperplane for classification
- **Neural Networks**: Complex pattern recognition

### Applications

- Email spam detection
- Credit scoring
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock price prediction
- Image classification

### Advantages

- Clear objective with measurable performance
- Well-understood algorithms
- Can achieve high accuracy with good data

### Disadvantages

- Requires large amounts of labeled data
- Labeling data can be expensive and time-consuming
- May not generalize well to unseen scenarios
