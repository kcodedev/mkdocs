# Purpose of Operating Systems

## Introduction to Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a software layer that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a stable environment for application programs to run. The primary purposes of an OS include:

- **Resource Management**: Efficiently allocating and managing hardware resources
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Hiding complex hardware details from users and applications
- **User Interface**: Providing accessible ways for users to interact with the system
- **Security**: Protecting system resources and user data
- **Process Management**: Coordinating multiple programs running simultaneously

## Hiding complexity

One role of the OS is to hide complexities from the user. For instance:

- A **GUI** hides complexity more than a CLI
- **Device drivers** hide the complexity of interfacing with hardware
- **Virus scanning** utilities and **update managers** auto run to free the user

## GUIs vs CLIs

| Feature | GUI (Graphical User Interface) | CLI (Command Line Interface) |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Ease of Use | Intuitive, visual, easier for beginners | Requires memorizing commands, steeper learning curve |
| Speed | Can be slower due to mouse clicks | Faster for experienced users, scripting |
| Flexibility | Limited to available options | Highly flexible, powerful scripting |
| Resource Usage | Higher (graphics, memory) | Lower |
| Error Handling | Visual feedback | Text-based, precise |
| Suitability | Everyday users, simple tasks | Developers, system admins, automation |
